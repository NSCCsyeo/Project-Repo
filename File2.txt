# Powershell script that will ask the user for two numbers, divide them, and give the modulo
# Ask the user for their first number
$firstnumber = Read-Host "Enter the first number"

# Ask the user for their second number
$secondnumber = Read-Host "Enter the second number"

# Convert the input strings to numbers
$firstnumber = [double]::Parse($firstnumber)
$secondnumber = [double]::Parse($secondnumber)

# Divide the two numbers and get the remainder
[double]$remainder = $firstnumber % $secondnumber

# Display the result
Write-Host "The quotient of $firstnumber divided by $secondnumber has a remainder of $remainder"
